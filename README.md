## Approach

The main goal of this project is to practice the implementation of Behaviour Driven Development on test automation using tools like Cypress, Cucumber and Gherkin. This approach will allow me to write test specifications in a human-redable way, utilising 'Gherkin' syntax and allowing 'Cucumber' to read those specifications and validate the software functionality. In this case, automated tests were created to review the functionality of main fetures in [Saucedemo website](https://www.saucedemo.com/).

Features to test:

- Log in
- Main products page
- Product detail
- Shopping cart
- Checkout

The implementation of CI/CD was included too, utilising tools like Github Actions, enabling to set up automated workflows to build, test, and deploy code when specific events occur in GitHub repository. Tags were added to run @smoke tests, @regression and @Ã¥feature tests when pushing a code update in Github
